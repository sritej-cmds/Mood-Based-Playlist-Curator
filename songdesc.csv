description
a slow rainy evening where memories feel heavier than usual
a quiet sunrise that feels like starting over
walking through empty streets after a long day
missing someone without wanting them back
a soft moment between laughter and silence
dancing alone but smiling anyway
late night thoughts that don’t let you sleep
feeling light after crying a little
watching city lights blur through a car window
the calm right before a storm
a long drive with no destination
the warmth of old memories replaying in your mind
the kind of night that makes you want to stay up forever
a quiet moment when everything finally makes sense
sitting near the ocean and thinking about nothing
the sound of rain and someone humming softly
a smile that hides a hundred untold stories
a moment of stillness after chaos
finding comfort in being alone
realizing you've changed but in a good way
one slow roneiny evening where memories feel heonevier thonen usuonel
